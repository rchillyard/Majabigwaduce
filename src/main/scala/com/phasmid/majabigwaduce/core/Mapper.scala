/**
  * The purpose of this mapper is to convert a sequence of objects into several sequences, each of which is
  * associated with a key. It must be possible to do further processing (the reduce phase) on each of these
  * resulting sequences independently (and, thus in parallel).
  * Furthermore, the mapping function should try, when possible, to divide the input sequence into a number
  * of more or less equally lengthy sequences.
  *
  * The mapper is an actor whose constructor takes a function f which converts a (K1,V1) into a (K2,W).
  * The receive method recognizes an KeyValuePairs[K1,V1] as a message.
  * It replies with a Try[Map[K2,Seq[W]\]\] which will be a Failure if any of the mappings fail.
  *
  * KeyValuePairs is a convenience wrapper for incoming messages. It has the advantage of not suffering type erasure,
  * and it also has a toString method which simply shows the number of pairs, not their values.
  *
  * This mapper is strict in the sense that if there are any mapping exceptions, then the mapper as a whole fails
  * and returns an empty map (after logging an error). However, you can change this behavior in the configuration
  * file by setting forgiving=true.
  *
  * TODO these statements are no longer true.
  * The normal reply is in the form of: Try[Map[K2,Seq[W]\]\] but, if the forgiving form of the mapper is used,
  * then the reply is in the form of a tuple: (Map[K2,Seq[W], Seq[Throwable])
  *
  * Note that logging the actual values received in the incoming message can be VERY verbose.
  * It is therefore recommended practice (if required) to log the values as they pass through the mapper function (f)
  * which is under the control of the application.
